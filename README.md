## 🧾 Project Summary

This project explores employment trends across industries, cities, and sub-industries in the U.S. from **2011 to 2014**, visualized using **Tableau**.

Using a structured dataset of employment figures, I developed a set of interactive dashboards that highlight key patterns, growth rates, and regional differences in employment trends. The visuals are designed for clarity, insight, and storytelling — empowering users to explore the data dynamically and draw actionable conclusions.
